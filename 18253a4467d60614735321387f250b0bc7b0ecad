please bump the ``symfony/routing`` min dependency as this constant does not exist in 2.1 (making 2.3 is fine)

And please also fix the tests to use the constant when defining expectations of the mock (which is why tests are broken with dev deps currently as the constant value changes in 3.0)

@WouterJ Any progress on that? Some tests still seem failing...

Ready to be merged
