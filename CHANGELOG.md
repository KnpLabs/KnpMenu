## 2.0.0 alpha 2 (2014-05-01)

* [BC break] Changed the TwigRenderer to accept a menu template only as a string
* [BC break] Refactored the way of rendering twig templates. Every template should extends
  the `knp_menu.html.twig` template.
* Introduced extension points in the MenuFactory through `Knp\Menu\Factory\ExtensionInterface`
* [BC break compared to 2.0 alpha 1] The inheritance extension points introduced in alpha1 are
  deprecated in favor of extensions and will be removed before the stable release.
* `Knp\Menu\Silex\RouterAwareFactory` is deprecated in favor of `Knp\Menu\Silex\RoutingExtension`.
* [BC break] Deprecated the methods `createFromArray` and `createFromNode` in the MenuFactory and
  removed them from `Knp\Menu\FactoryInterface`. Use `Knp\Menu\Loader\ArrayLoader` and
  `Knp\Menu\Loader\NodeLoader` instead.
* [BC break] Deprecated the methods `moveToPosition`, `moveToFirstPosition`, `moveToLastPosition`,
  `moveChildToPosition`, `callRecursively`, `toArray`, `getPathAsString` and `getBreadcrumbsArray`
  in the MenuItem and removed them from `Knp\Menu\ItemInterface`. Use `Knp\Menu\Util\MenuManipulator`
  instead.
* Made the RouterVoter compatible with SensioFrameworkExtraBundle param converters
* Added the possibility to match routes using a regex on their name in the RouterVoter
* [BC break compared to 2.0 alpha 1] Refactored the RouterVoter to make it more flexible
    The way to pass routes in the item extras has changed.

    Before:

    ```php
    'extras' => array(
        'routes' => array('foo', 'bar'),
        'routeParameters' => array('foo' => array('id' => 4)),
    )
    ```

    After:

    ```php
    'extras' => array(
        'routes' => array(
             array('route' => 'foo', 'parameters' => array('id' => 4)),
            'bar',
        )
    )
    ```

    The old syntax is kept until the final release, but using it will trigger a E_USER_DEPRECATED error.

## 2.0.0 alpha 1 (2013-06-23)

* Added protected methods `buildOptions` and `configureItem` in the MenuFactory as extension point by inheritance
* [BC break] Refactored the way to mark items as current
  ``setCurrentUri``, ``getCurrentUri`` and ``getCurrentItem`` have been removed from the ItemInterface.
  Determining the current items is now delegated to a matcher, and the default implementation
  uses voters to apply the matching. Getting the current items can be done thanks to the CurrentItemFilterIterator.
* [BC break] The signature of the CurrentItemFilterIterator constructor changed to accept the item matcher
* [BC break] Changed the format of the breadcrumb array
  Instead of storing the elements with the label as key and the uri as value
  the array now stores an array of array elements with 3 keys: `label`, `uri` and `item`.
